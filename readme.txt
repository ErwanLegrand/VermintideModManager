Installation:

- Unzip VMM.exe and 4 Dlls where ever you want.
- If you want automatic mod manager updates unzip Updater.exe.

Usage:

VMM should find the game folder on its own.
You may have to download the latest framework first.
Button "Install VMF" on the left top installs the mod framework.
After that you can activate mods in your current profile.
The Mod Finder allows you to browse for mods and download them directly.
