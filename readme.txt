Installation:

Unzip / put vmm.exe and dlls where ever you want.
Put the files of the mod framework into a "mod" subfolder.

Usage:

VMM should find the game folder on its own.
Press the button on the left top "Install VMF".
After that you can activate mods in your current profile.
You may have to download the latest framework first.

Functionality:

VMM doesn't actually put the mod files into the game folder.
Instead it will create symbolic links for the files.
Better for hdd, faster switching of profiles.

Features:

- Manage mod activation in profiles
- Display mod requirements
- Direct access to content of mod packages
- Find and download mods
