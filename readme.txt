Installation:

Unzip / put vmm.exe and dlls where ever you want.
Put the files of the mod framework into a "Mod" subfolder.

Usage:

VMM should find the game folder on its own.
Press the button on the left top "Install VMF".
After that you can activate mods in your current profile.

Functionality:

VMM doesn't actually put the mod files into the game folder.
Instead it will create symbolic links for the files.
Better for hdd, faster switching of profiles.

Features:

- Manage mod activation in profiles
- Display mod requirements
- Direct access to content of mod packages
